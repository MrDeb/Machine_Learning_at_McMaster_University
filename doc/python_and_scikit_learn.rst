Python, Its Tools and Libraries 
================================

In this part, we will first install python 3.6 and some libraries with the help of pip.
Then we will show how to work with one of the best tools for python learning and teaching, ipython.
However, if you don't like the command line way of programming, the easiest way is to install Anaconda,

#. **Install Python**
   
   Although Python 2 has been widely used, we recommand to use Python 3 instead. If you have some projects
   written in python 2, there are some optinional ways for version control of python.

   Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/, and download the latest version of python.

#. **Install Pip**
   
   It is recommended to install pip 3 in accordancen with python 3.6. A detailed instruction 
   can be found: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/. One converntial way install it is with this script:
   https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py.

   We can use pip to install, upgrade, uninstall python packages.

#. **Install Scikit-learn**
 
   The offical website of scikit-learn is a gold ore: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html. Install scikit by pip.
